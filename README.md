# Showcase
### The GitHub Profile Showcaser!

## Introduction
A free service to help you create a beautiful and interactive way to display your GitHub profile easily using the [GitHub Rest API][git-rest-api]. You can even have a little fun and get a random cat fact from both the Front page and from one of our themes!

## User Story
I want an easy way to build beautiful developer profile pages and show off the latest repositories that a user has created and/or worked on simply by using their GitHub username.

## Live Deployment

## The [MaterializeCSS][materializecss] Framework

For CSS we've decided to use MaterializeCSS as it is light weight, gets out of the way and makes for a stuningly beautiful, yet simple website that is mobile first and helps bring the project to life.

## We use both vanilla [JavaScript][javascript] and [jQuery][jquery].

For added functionality we are using both vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to keep our codebase light and efficent.
